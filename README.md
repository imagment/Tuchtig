# Tüchtig Script

**Description**: Yes, there is a description.

**Documentation**: Currently, no.

But don't worry! We will add the documentation as soon as possible. <br>
In the meantime, since we haven’t removed any functions from Sam-Astro's Z# which the project we remixed. <br>
his existing documentation may be helpful if you'd like to start using Tüchtig right away. <br>
<br>
Thank you for your patience!
